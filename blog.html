          <p>When you build a home you're building a future - so your relationship with your building partner is of vital importance. If you have a strong relationship, you'll be more trusting, more patient and more likely to be satisfied with the finished product.</p>
          <p>Luckily, building that relationship can be straightforward if you know what you're doing, and pick the best Perth home builder.
          A strong relationship with your builder will make it easier to build a home you love.</p>
          <h3>Choose your Perth home builder well</h3>
          <p>There are 328,500 construction companies in Australia, according to IBISWorld data. That means you'll have plenty of builders to choose from, so make sure you take time to ensure you've made the right choice. Nothing ruins a relationship quicker than choosing an unqualified, unprofessional builder who can't deliver on what they promise. Look for experience, reputation and value in your building company. Check online reviews, speak to old customers, and if you can visit Perth display homes to see what they're capable of.</p>
          <h3>Make your life easier by befriending your building consultant.</h3>
          <p>There's so much to learn before you build a home. You may be researching design trends, council registrations and building timeframes all at once which can get a bit overwhelming. Make your life easier by befriending your building consultant. Their job is to guide you through the planning stages of your build from picking designs to signing a contract and everything in between. Having a solid, trusting relationship with your consultant will mean these important early steps are easier to take. You'll feel comfortable leaving everything in the capable hands of your consultant.</p>
          <h3>Get it in writing</h3>
          <p>Your building contract is one of the most important and integral documents to the entire build. It sets a foundation on which you can build trust, and of course a home that you'll love. Your contract should include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All contract terms set out in full.</li>
            <li>Details of all the fixtures, fittings and finishes in your home.</li>
            <li>Detailed description of all work to be carried out.</li>
            <li>Start and finish date of the work.</li>
            <li>The price of the build.</li>
            <li>Details of insurance. </li>
            <li>All warranties included.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you have any questions, or are unclear on any part of your contract always ask your building consultant to clarify. It's best to clear up any issues before the contract is finalised to avoid confusion when the build has already begun.</p>
          <h3>Have patience and trust</h3>
          <p>If you've picked a home builder well, gone through your contract meticulously and built a relationship with your building consultant, there's no reason to stress during the build. There will be rainy days and setbacks but if you have trust and patience these problems won't cause a rift between you and your builder, and will be quickly solved. To find out more about the build process, get in touch with the team here at apg homes and make a start building that relationship.</p>
